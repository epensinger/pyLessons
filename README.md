# pyLessons

- pyLessons is a collection of lessons, example code, and exercises to reinforce programming fundamentals in the python language.
- pyLessons is organized according to fundamental coding concepts rather than python fundamentals though it is in the python language.

## Generally the outline for the lessons is:

- Unit 1 - Intro to Data
- Unit 2 - Functions
- Unit 3 - Conditional Statements
- Unit 4 - Looping and Lists
- Unit 5 - Dictionaries
- Unit 6 - Classes
- Unit 7 - Modules

Functions have been moved earlier in the ordering of the lessons than they appear in many beginning programming courses.

This choice occured for four reasons:

    1. Functions allow learners to isolate segments of code and identify problem areas more quickly.
    2. Functions allow learners to work on more interesting programs by simply calling complex functions that have been provided.
    3. Learners can develop the habit of using functions from the start.
    4. Learners report that functions are easier to learn than Dictionaries and Loops.

The focus of this course is to provide greater context for exercises along the way.  Most courses provide small exercises without the rest of the program and learners have to imagine how this might work in the real world.  In this course, the entire program exists, and learners write specific parts.  This helps them understand the context of their work.  There are also small exercises where learners write the whole program from scratch.  

Ultimately this course will incorporate paired programming, encouraging learners to practice working with a teammate to complete goals.  https://www.khanacademy.org/khan-for-educators/resources/teacher-essentials/teaching-computing/a/pair-programming-in-the-classroom
