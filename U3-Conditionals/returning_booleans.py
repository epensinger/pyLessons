#1. Write a function called needJacket that takes two parameters - temp and conditions
      #The temp will be a float (number with a decimal)
      #The conditions will be a string - fog, rain, sun, clouds, storm, snow
      #Here's when you need a jacket:
        #A. when it's colder than 50 degrees regardless of the weather.
        #B. when it's colder than 60 degrees and fog or clouds
        #C. when it's any temperature and rain, storm, or snow.
      #Your function should return true if you need a jacket and false if you don't need a jacket.
      
      
      
      
#2. Write a function called big_Enough that takes three integers - length, width, size_needed
      #The function should return true if the area (length times width) is larger than the size needed.
      #The function should return false if the area (length times width) is smaller than the size needed.
    
    
    
#3.  Write a function called will_fit that takes four numbers, the length and width of an object and the length and width of a space
      #Write a function that checks to see if the object will fit.  
      #Make sure to check to see if the object will fit if you rotate it.
      #Return true if it fits, false if it doesn't.
