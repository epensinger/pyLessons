# Adding Alternatives

## Lesson Goal
Provide alternate code to run when the initial condition is False
Use elif to provide alternate conditions after the initial condition is False

## Comparison Operators Review

| Operator | What it does                                  | Example | Result if X = 1 and Y = 1 | Result if X = 1 and Y = 2 |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ==       | Truthy if X has the same value as Y           | X == Y  | True                      | False                     |
| !=       | Truthy if X does not have the same value as Y | X!=Y    | False                     | True                      |
| >        | Truthy if X is greater than Y                 | X > Y   | False                     | False                     |
| <        | Truthy if X is less than Y                    | X < Y   | False                     | True                      |
| >=       | Truthy if X is greater than or equal to Y     | X >= Y  | True                      | False                     |
| <=       | Truthy if X is less than or equal to Y        | X <= Y  | True                      | True                      |

## Else

Use the keyword else for code to run if the condition evaluates to False

Ex:

```python
num = 6

if num > 10:  
    # Because the condition is false this doesn't run
    print("more than 10")
else:
    # This line will run because the initial condition is false
    print("less than 10")

```

You can have multiple lines in else and you can call functions just like if
Indentation really matters


---

## Else examples
```python
age = input("How old are you?")
age = int(age)

if age >= 16:
    print("Please drive safely.")
else:
    print("You need a driver.")

if age >= 25:
    print("Please drive a kid.")
else:
    print("You may not drive a kid.")

if age <= 5:
    print("You need a carseat")
else:
    print("Please buckle up!")
```


---

# elif

Use the keyword elif to test for a secondary condition that will run if the first condition is false

EX:
```python
num = 6
if num > 10:  
    # Because the condition is false this doesn't run
    print("more than 10")
elif num == 10:
    #This test will run because the first test was false
    #The code won't run because this test is false
    print("The number is 10") 
else:
    # This line will run because the initial condition is false
    print("less than 10")
```

You can have multiple lines in else and you can call functions just like if
Indentation really matters

## Elif Example:

```python
if letter == "a":
    morse_code = "._"
elif letter == "b":
    morse_code = "_..."
elif letter == "c":
    morse_code = "_._."
else:
    print("Sorry I was too lazy to do that letter")
```

## A Practical Examples:

Testing user input:

```python
chars = input("Say something")

if chars.isalpha():
    print("You entered letters")
    #You can put code here to work with strings
elif chars.isdecimal():
    print("You entered numbers")
    #You can convert chars to an int and do math with it here
elif chars.isspace():
    print("You entered all spaces")
else:
    print("It seems you entered a combination of diferent kinds of characters")

```
