# Lesson 2 - Built in Functions with Strings

## Lesson Goals
Call built in functions

Pass strings to built in functions

---

## Functions
**Function** - a block of code that carries out a specific task (not attached to an object)

**Built in Function** - functionality that is always available

```
print("This")
#Print is a built-in function!
```


---

## Passing Values to Functions
**Function Call** - an expression that tells python to execute a function

**Argument** - values that are passed to a function in the function call

Many functions take a value (or a few values), do something with it, and give a value back.  

You should know what kind of value it's expecting and what it will do with it.

The value you are passing into the function goes in the parenthesis.

You can pass in the actual value, or a variable. 

IF the function takes multiple arguments, you pass them in order, separated by commas (more later).


---

## Example - Print Function
Takes a string

Displays it in the interpreter 

```python
print("Hello World!")
```


---

## Recieving Values from Functions
**return** - value is transfered from the function to the function call.

If a function returns a value, assign the function call to a variable to use it later.

In your lessons, I use the comment #==> to tell you what a function returns, but I don't do that in actual projects.


---

## Example - Input Function

```
name = input("What is your name?")
```

- Displays the argument (like the print statement)

- Returns the user's input as a string.

Alternatively:
```python
print("What is your name?")
name = input()
```


---

## Another example - Length Function
Takes a string (and other things we'll learn about later like lists)

Returns the length of the string as a number

```python
name = "pikachu"
letters = len(name) #==> returns 7 
```


---

## Another Example - Type Function
Takes any object

Sends back the type of object

```python
cat = "Scout"
type(cat) #==> str

cost = 5.99
type(cost) #==> float
)
