# Parameters and Arguments

## Parameters
- variables that are passed to a function
- placeholders that are assigned when you call the function
- scope is the function only.  (in English: they only apply inside their function, you can use the same names elsewhere and it is not the same value)

## Arguments
- the values you pass to the function in the function call
- some people use these interchangeably 


---

## Example Code

```python
def add(a,b):
    return a+b

add(4,8)
```
- a and b are parameters
- 4 and 8 are arguments.
- when you call the function and pass 4 and 8, the function assigns 4 to a and 8 to b
- it then evaluates the expression a + b as 4 + 8
- it returns the value 12


---

## Another Example

```python
def multiply(first, second):
    return first * second

x = multiply(5,10) # 50
y = multiply(2,6) # 12
```
- the first time you call the function, 5 is assigned to first and 10 to second.
- the function returns 50 which is assigned to x
- the second time you call the function, 2 is assigned to first and 6 to second.
- the function returns 12 which is assigned to y


---

## Naming Parameters
```python
# Not great
def print_full_name(string1, string2):
    return(f"Your full name is {string1} {string2}")

# Better
def print_full_name(first_name, last_name):
    return(f"Your full name is {first_name} {last_name}")


---

# Also not great
def area(x,y):
    return x * y

# Much better
def area(length, width):
    return length * width

```
- the names you choose for your parameters should give a hint about what you expect will be passed in.
- remember the parameter only exists within that function


---

## A longer Example
```python
l = int(input("What is the length?"))
w = int(input("What is the width?"))

def area(length, width):
    return length * width

a = area(l,w)

```
- this also works
```python
length = int(input("What is the length?"))
width = int(input("What is the width?"))

def area(length, width):
    return length * width

a = area(length,width)
```


---

# Parameters vs Arguments

- A parameter is a placeholder in the definition.
- When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.
- But the line between these can be blurry so you may see them used interchangeably.
