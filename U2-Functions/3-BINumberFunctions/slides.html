# Lesson 3 - Built-In Functions with Numbers

In this lesson you will learn to use built in functions that expect values that are numbers.


---

## Review - Passing Values to Functions
**Function Call** - an expression that tells python to execute a function

**Argument** - values that are passed to a function in the function call

Many functions take a value (or a few values), do something with it, and give a value back.  

You should know what kind of value it's expecting and what it will do with it.

The value you are passing into the function goes in the parenthesis.

You can pass in the actual value, or a variable. 

IF the function takes multiple arguments, you pass them in order, separated by commas (more now).


---

## Passing numbers to functions
Works exactly like strings, you can put the actual number or a variable.

Often pass more than one value -- order matters!


---

## Example - Round Function

**round(number[, ndigits])**

first parameter is the number you want to round, second parameter is the number of decimals you want to round to

negative ndigits would give you tens, hundreds etc.

[those brackets mean it's optional - if you don't put any it will round to the nearest integer]

```python
ones = round(3.14159)  #==> 3

tenths = round(3.14159, 1) #==> 3.1

hundredths = round(3.14159, 2) #==> 3.14

tens = round(2354, -1) #==> 2350

hundreds = round(1234, -2) #==> 1200
```


---

## Example - Absolute Value
**abs(number)**

takes a number and returns the absolute value

(absolute value is when you ignore the negative)

Helpful when finding differences between numbers.

```
#what's the distance between loc_1 and loc_2?
loc_1 = 3
loc_2 = 8
abs(loc_1 - loc_2) #==> 5

#What's the difference between guess and answer?
guess = 7
answer = 2
abs(answer - guess) #==> 5 
```


---

## Almost Built in Random Number Function

We have to import the Random module to use the random function

```
#import Random Module
import random
some_num = random.randint(1,10) #==> some integer between 1 and 10 inclusive
```

randint takes 2 parameters - the minimum number and maximum number

it returns a number greater than or equal to the first parameter and less than or equal to the last number
