#It stores first name and last name in the variables first and last.
#DON'T TOUCH THEM.

#We will do some conditional tests on the name, so we need to check formatting.
#Each time you write code, test the user input and make sure it does what you want.

#1. Remove any white space from the left side of first.


#2. Remove any white space from the right side of first.


#3. Remove any white space on either side of last.


#4. Make sure first is all lower case.


#5. Make sure last is in title case.


#6. Create a variable called yell_first and store the first name in all upper case in it.
