# Lesson 2 String Concatenation
In this lesson you will learn to write your first expression.  

## Expressions
_expression_ a combination of values and operators that evaluate to a single value.

_value_ - a single piece of data that exists (ex: "my words")

_operator_ - symbol that indicates how to evaluate data (ex: +, -)

_evaluate_ - to reduce an expression to its simplest form (solve the math problem, combine the strings, determine truthiness or falseness)

value operator value 

OR

value operator value operator value operator value, etc.


## Our first expression
- the values will be strings
- the operators will be a plus sign


_string concatenation_ combining one or more strings

```python
#the expression
"cat" + "dog" 
#evaluates to
"catdog"

#the expression 
"Mr. " + "Arnold"
#Evaluates to
"Mr. Arnold"
```
