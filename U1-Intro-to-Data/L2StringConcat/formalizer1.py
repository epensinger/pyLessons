# This program needs to spit out the formal version of a person's name. 
# Under each person's name, print the correct title - Mr or Ms along with their name.  
# For example, Joe Smith, male would print out Mr. Smith
# I'm asking you to use concatenation to combine the title and the last name, even though you could do it another way.
