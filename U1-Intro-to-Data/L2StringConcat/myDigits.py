# When dialing from overseas to the United States, you have to add stuff to the phone number to get it to go through.
# In Japan you have to dial 010 to get out of the country, then 1, then the area code and number.
# So the number 423-264-3445 would be 010-1-423-264-3445

# Use concatenation to combine the digits to dail out of Japan with your phone number and print it out.
