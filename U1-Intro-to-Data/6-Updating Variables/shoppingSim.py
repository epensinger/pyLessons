#Let's build a little store.  Read along and add the code where intsructed.  
#Feel free to be creative with the text of your messages and what you sell in the store.

#1.  Set up the store.  Start by creating 5 variables to store the cost of different items.  
# The items can be whatever you want, go with basic food items if you are stuck - apple, carrot, candy_bar, etc.








#2. Give the user some Money.  Create a variable called cash and store 100 in it.  
#This is how much money you will have when the program starts.






#4.  Greet the User.  Write a print statement to say something like welcome to the store.  





#5. Tell the user what is for sale.  Write a print statement for each item in the store.  




#6. Skipping some logic we don't know yet, pretend your user picked one of the items. 
#Write a print statement to tell the user what they picked and how much it costs.




#7. Update the value of their money, subracting the value of the item they purchased.





#8. Tell them how much money they have left.




#9.  They bought something else, tell them what they bought and how much it costs.




#10. Tell them how much money they have left.
