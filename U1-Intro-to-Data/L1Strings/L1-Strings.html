# Lesson 1 Strings
In this lesson you will learn to write a string in python.

---

## Syntax 
- the python interpreter runs all of the code in the python file from top to bottom.
- the interpreter understands code that is witten according to python syntax.

_syntax_ - the way characters must be arranged to create meaning that can be understood

---

## Comments
- we can include information for humans in our programs and tell the interpreter to ignore it
- this is called a comment
- python comments are indicated with a #
- you can also use # to tell python to ignore a line of code while you are testing and debugging your program

---

## Strings
_string_ a series of characters that make up a value to be used by the computer
- strings must be set off in quotes- either single or double quotes

```python
"this is a string"
"555-213-5245"
'Pa55w0rd'
```
---

## Multi-Line Strings
- use three quotes to create a string of multiple lines.
- the string will be stored with new lines exactly where you put them.

```python
''' Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I can write code,
How about you?'''
```
