#In this assignment we will use variables to increase the efficiency of our formalizer program.

# This program needs to spit out the formal version of a person's name. 
# Under each person's name, print the correct title - Mr or Ms along with their name.  
# For example, Joe Smith, male would print out Mr. Smith
# This is the new part:  store Mr.  and Ms.  in variables and use the variable in your expression.
# You may copy as much as you like from the previous file, but you must use a variable for Mr. and Ms.
