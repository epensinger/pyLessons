#Let's apply what we have learned about variables to our digits program from the string concatenation lesson.


# When dialing from overseas to the United States, you have to add stuff to the phone number to get it to go through.
# In Japan you have to dial 010 to get out of the country, then 1, then the area code and number.
# So the number 423-264-3445 would be 010-1-423-264-3445

# This time store 010-1- in a variable and use concatenation to add it to a string which is a phone number.
# Store the result of your concatenation in a NEW variable called japan_number
