# We're going to add to the program in which we made variables to store the values of gems.

# In that program your assignment was to do the following:
# Create a varaible for several gems - ruby, saphire, diamond, opal, amber.
# In the variable, store a value between 10 and 100 that represents the amount of coins you will get for that gem.
# You may copy and paste that here or redo it.

# AFTER you have added the variables, we are going to use them to find the value of purses that contain certain gems.

# red_purse contains a ruby, a saphire, and a diamond.  Write an expression using those variables to store the value in red_purse.



# blue_purse contains a saphire, an opal, amber, and a diamond.  Write an expression using those variables to store the value in blue_purse.



# green_purse contains 2 diamonds, a ruby, and a saphire.  Write an expression using those variables to store the value in green_purse.
