# Unit 1 Intro to Data
We are going to start really really basic.  A computer is something (or someone) that computes.  The stuff it computes is data.  Sound, video, images, keystrokes, numbers, characters, all of that is data.  Computer programming is about giving the computer a set of instructions for how to compute certain data.  The products of those computations could come together as songs, movies, video games, websites, calculators, actions taken by robots, and who knows what else we haven't thought of yet.  However, at the core, it all boils down to giving the computer some data and telling it how to compute it.  In this unit, we begin with data.

## Objectives:
Represent numbers and characters as data types in Python
Write expressions that can be evaluated to a single value
Store values in variables

## Lessons:
1. Strings
- in this lesson you will learn to represent a series of characters as a string.
2. String concatenation
- in this lesson you will learn to write expressions that evaluate to a single string.
3. Numbers
- in this lesson you will learn to represent numbers as either floats or characters.
4. Numerical Expressions
- in this lesson you will learn to use mathematical operators to write numerical expressions.
5. Variable Assignment
- in this lesson you will learn to store your data in variables. 
6. Variable Expressions
- in this lesson you will learn to replace exact values with variables in your expressions.
7. Updating Variables
- in this lesson you will learn to update the values stored in your variables.
